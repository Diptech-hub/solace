# Solace-Demo
This is a demo of [Solace](https://github.com/diptech-hub/solace) and was made  during a [course]

Make a file `config.json`
```json
{
    "mongoURI": "mongodb://localhost/Solace-Demo"
    "token": "OTA5NDM5OTQwMDk2NTg5ODQ0.YZET8g.ojXe10g5OXDL2ThB6FBkHnTpF6Y"
}
```

## Notes
#### Make sure `config.json` is in `gitignore`.
This will help secure your bot token, and make sure your bot does not get hacked.
